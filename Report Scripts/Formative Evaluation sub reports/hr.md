### Healthy Relationship Analysis

The pre survey result indicates that the students in the program do not have strong relationship skills as compared to past years and this is a potential growth area for the students. Typically 61 percent of the students come into this program with strong healthy relationship skills whereas this year it was under 40 percent.

Parent and teacher survey support the evidence from the students surveys. Nearly three-quarters of parents either indicated high agreement that their child had positive relationship at school. Following the student survey pattern, this is a 10 percent decrease from the pre survey last year. Nearly two-thirds of teachers havea a high agreement that the students have developed positive relationships.

Reviewing the distribution of pre surveys scores indicates that 172 students are between 3.45 and the 4.45 cutpoint. The healthy relationship outcome skill is a strong point for the Get REAL! program as evidenced by previous years. Last year 26 percent of students improved from a low skill level to a high skill level and over 85 percent had success with this outcome.
